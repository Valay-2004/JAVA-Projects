# Java Projects

**This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed to strengthen understanding of core Java concepts and build a foundation for advanced frameworks like Spring Boot.**

All projects are written in pure Java, focusing on practical learning through hands-on implementation. Emphasis is on clarity, correctness, and gradual improvement.

---
### Core Concepts Covered
   - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
   - Encapsulation and abstraction
   - Exception handling
   - Collections framework
   - File handling and persistence
   - Console-based user interaction
   - Basic system design and data management

---
## Projects 
   1. [Bank Account Simulator](./Bank%20Account%20Simulator/BankAccountSimulator)
   2. [Student Grade Management System (StudentGMS)](./StudentGMS)
   3. [File Backup Utility](./FileBackupUtility/FileBackupUtility)

---
### How to Run Projects
All projects are console-based and use standard Java without external build tools.
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Valay-2004/JAVA-Projects.git
```    
2. Navigate to the project directory and follow its specific README for compilation and execution.

---
### Scope for Improvement
These projects are kept simple for learning. Future enhancements could include:
- JDBC for database support
- Better persistence and data consistency
- Authentication mechanisms
- Enhanced validation and error handling
- Unit tests with JUnit
- Migration to Spring Boot

---
### Purpose
This repository documents a learning journey in Java, practicing real-world problem-solving and building confidence in application design.
