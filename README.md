# Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects developed to strengthen my understanding of core Java concepts and to build a solid foundation for future work with advanced frameworks such as Spring Boot.

All projects are written in pure Java and focus on practical learning through hands-on implementation. The repository emphasizes clarity, correctness, and gradual improvement over complexity.

---

## Core Concepts Covered

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Exception handling
- Collections framework
- File handling and persistence
- Console-based user interaction
- Basic system design and data management

## Projects Overview

### Bank Account Simulator  
**Directory:** `Bank Account Simulator/BankAccountSimulator`

A console-based banking application that simulates common banking operations.

**Key Features:**
- Create and manage bank accounts
- Support for multiple account types
- Deposit and withdraw functionality
- Balance inquiry
- Transaction logging
- Input validation and custom exceptions

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Practical application of OOP principles
- Handling state changes and persistence
- Separation of responsibilities across classes
- Working with monetary values using `BigDecimal`

### Student Grade Management System (StudentGMS)  
**Directory:** `StudentGMS`

A console-based student management system for maintaining academic records.

**Key Features:**
- Add, update, and remove student records
- Assign and manage grades or marks
- Calculate averages, percentages, or GPA
- Display student reports
- Search functionality by identifier
- Optional file-based data persistence

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Working with collections such as `ArrayList`
- Implementing search and basic sorting logic
- Structuring medium-sized console applications
- Managing data through simple storage mechanisms

## How to Run the Projects

All projects are console-based and use standard Java without external build tools.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Valay-2004/JAVA-Projects.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ProjectName
   ```

3. Compile and run the application:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

If packages are used:
```bash
javac -d . *.java
java com.example.Main
```

## Scope for Improvement

These projects are intentionally kept simple and focused on learning. Possible future improvements include:
- Integrating database support using JDBC
- Improving persistence and data consistency
- Adding authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Enhancing validation and error handling
- Writing unit tests using JUnit
- Migrating selected projects to Spring Boot

## Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey in Java, practice real-world problem solving, and build confidence in designing and maintaining small-to-medium-scale applications.
