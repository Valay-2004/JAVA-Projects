This is a sample file we will be using to test the backup manager

Now this is the update I am doing here
Let's run our main method after writing here something and check what happens

Yup the project is working now let's refactor it and add other techs
like zip compression and SHA check.

The SHA check will be added later now we will be adding the zip compression
and thus we can use either of them zip or folder backup based on what the user wants.
